I completed my Web Development course in Programming Hero. Through the course, I gained practical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and various frameworks. I have also worked on several projects, including building responsive websites and implementing interactive features. These experiences have sharpened my technical abilities and fostered my attention to detail.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Redux and Next.js
